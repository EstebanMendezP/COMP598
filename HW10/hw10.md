The question of why I selected this tree oportunities is susprinsigy not that complicated. When looking for a Data Science job the first thing that I think is what company would have cool data thats need to be analyze. Beacouser of this all Bell, Morgan and Dejardins, I think would have an interesting Data that could interest any Data Analysit.

And last they are in Canada so application and life after university would be easier to set up, that if had to move to another new country.
